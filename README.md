## Technical Exercise Senior Mobile Application Developer

### Art Institute Of Chicago Catalog App

We want to build a mobile application that allows a user to navigate the events exposed by the Art Institute of Chicago API.

### Documentation | Art Institute of Chicago API

- The user should be able to see a thumbnail and a small description of each event in the main screen of the app.
- When clicking on a thumbnail the user must be sent to a detailed screen of the event containing a better quality image and more detailed information about the piece, the author, and any other data you consider might be relevant for the end user.
- The user should be able to save some favorite events, and should be able to explore them even after the application is completely closed and reopened.

#### NOTES:

- You should use animated transitions and any other cool feature you consider will show up how experienced you are in mobile development.
- Your solution will be evaluated on code quality, clarity and development best practices.
- Build the application using React Native CLI and Typescript.
- Additional bonus if you implement some kind of push notifications.
- Select you preferred platform (iOS or Android) and create your own Native Module using the Bridge or the new Fabric Native Components to add the events schedules into the user calendar (Please don't use a react native package)
- Please share with us the link of the repository containing the application source code when finished and let us know to schedule the meeting to review the app.Feel free to ping us any question you might have about this technical assessment.

#### IMPORTANT:

If you are scheduled to have a technical interview to review the application, it is very important that you have your source code, IDE, and your application ready to be run prior to the meeting.
